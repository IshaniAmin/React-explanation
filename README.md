### Props

This is how information or data is passed from a parent to a child. It is a way for information to be transferred and used between different componenets. Props are always passed from the top component (parent) to the bottom component (child).

### State

This is how the component's data is at a specific time. In the beginning, a component's state is established and later it can be manipulated.

### Component Life Cycle

There are three phases: **Mounting**, **Updating**, and **Unmounting**. They can vary depending on what the application is doing. 

- Mounting: When the component is first created to when it is being rendered or when the application is first opened
- Updating: When the component is being used or when the application is being updated
- Unmounting: When the component is ready to finish being used


From the moment your component is born - when it's initially being rendered - it enters the Mounting Phase. Once your component is living a happy life and is being updated it enters the Updating Phase. Finally when it's time to end it's life it enters the Unmounting Phase.
